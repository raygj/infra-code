If you still see permission denied after verifying the permissions of the parent folders, it may be SELinux restricting access.

To check if SELinux is running:

# getenforce
To disable SELinux until next reboot:

# setenforce Permissive
Restart Nginx and see if the problem persists. To allow nginx to serve your www directory (make sure you turn SELinux back on before testing this. i.e, setenforce Enforcing)

# chcon -Rt httpd_sys_content_t /path/to/www
